# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in [programming language].

## Description

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hands. These shapes are:

- Rock (a closed fist)
- Paper (a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The game has a simple set of rules:

- Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
- Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
- Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cuts Paper)

This implementation allows you to play the game against the computer in a command-line interface.
